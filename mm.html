<span class="auto-style2">Fruit and vegetables</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;should be an important part of your daily diet. They are naturally good 
and contain vitamins and minerals that can help to keep you healthy. They can 
also help protect against some diseases.<br />
<br />
Most Australians will benefit from eating more fruit and vegetables as part of a 
well-balanced, healthy diet and an active lifestyle. There are many varieties of 
fruit and vegetables available and many ways to prepare, cook and serve them.<br />
<br />
Fruit and vegetables are best bought when they are in season. Otherwise try 
frozen or canned vegetables as they are just as nutritious and budget-friendly 
as well.<br />
<br />
You should eat at least 5 serves of vegetables and 2 serves of fruit each day. 
Choose different colours and varieties.<br />
<br />
If you are someone who doesn’t look forward to eating fruit or vegetables, start 
slowly with those you do like. Try serving, flavouring or cooking them in 
different ways. You can also disguise them in sauces, minced meals or curries</p>
